# 2xðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ 2-layer DiffieHellman [![](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/vim-mode)](https://github.com/Red-company/RES_Implementation/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

## What is it?

This is my conception, implementation and tests of advanced(2-layer) _DiifieHellman_ key exchange _protocol_ that works with _very long inegers_(like 19.729 chars long, can work with bigger ones without any problems). You also can find an _example file(main.cpp)_ at this repository with it's description. It is also a part of [_RedLibrary_](https://github.com/Red-company/RedLibrary).
